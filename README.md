# Flow

Libraries for flow-based programming

**Note:** These libraries are still subject to change.

## Quick start

Clone this repository, install it with Maven, create the samples package,
and start the demo application:

    git clone https://github.com/javagl/Flow.git
    cd Flow
    mvn clean install
    cd flow-samples
    mvn assembly:assembly
    cd target
    java -jar flow-samples-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-demoJar.jar
    
That's it.

 

## Overview

This repository contains the following sub-projects:

* [flow-core](https://github.com/javagl/Flow/tree/master/flow-core) : 
  The core library, containing the basic classes for flow-based programming:
  A `Flow` that consists of `Module` objects, where two modules can be
  connected with a `Link`, and which may be executed with a `FlowExecutor`.

* [flow-module-creation](https://github.com/javagl/Flow/tree/master/flow-module-creation) : 
  Classes related to the `ModuleCreator` interface - a factory that can create
  `Module` instances.

* [flow-workspace](https://github.com/javagl/Flow/tree/master/flow-workspace) :
  Classes for managing the infrastructure that a flow-based-programming 
  application can be based upon: A `FlowWorkspace` that describes an 
  (editable) state of the `Flow` that was created with the application. 

* [flow-gui](https://github.com/javagl/Flow/tree/master/flow-gui) :
  An application offering a graphical user interface for visual-interactive
  flow-based programming
  
* [flow-io](https://github.com/javagl/Flow/tree/master/flow-io) :
  Classes for reading and writing XML files that contain 
  flow definitions. 

* [flow-repository](https://github.com/javagl/Flow/tree/master/flow-repository) :
  A simple repository for module definitions

* [flow-module-definitions-basic](https://github.com/javagl/Flow/tree/master/flow-module-definitions-basic) :
  Some basic `Module` definitions, for modules that allow entering 
  values or print objects to the console.
  
* [flow-samples](https://github.com/javagl/Flow/tree/master/flow-samples) :
  Example applications showing how to use the flow library
  
See the `README.md` of each project for further information.

 
## Implementing custom modules

**TODO** Explain


## Notes about type inference

**TODO** Just make clear that it is **really** hard...


## Design choices

**TODO** Elaborate

- No `public` classes for the model, no `public` constructors
- Everything is observable via `...Listener` interfaces
- ... 

## Future tasks

**TODO** Add some ideas here
